## Overview

**MCP Progress Poster** is a custom-built **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** designed to automate _build in public_ updates for developers.

While consistently learning **Data Structures and Algorithms**, I wanted a frictionless way to share my daily progress publicly—without manually writing posts every day. This project solves that problem by converting real coding activity into meaningful social updates using AI-aware context.

## Motivation

The _build in public_ movement encourages developers to share what they learn daily. However, maintaining consistency becomes difficult when updates are repetitive and time-consuming.

While practicing DSA daily inside **VS Code**, I noticed that **GitHub Copilot** already understands:

- What I worked on
- Which problems I solved
- My learning focus for the day

Instead of manually summarizing progress, I decided to automate the entire workflow using an MCP server.

## How It Works

1. I practice DSA and write code throughout the day in VS Code
2. Copilot maintains contextual awareness of my work
3. I trigger a single command:

> **Post my today’s progress on Twitter**

4. The MCP server:
   - Extracts relevant learning context
   - Generates a concise and meaningful update
   - Publishes it directly to **Twitter** using the Twitter API

## Key Features

- 🧠 Context-aware content generation using MCP
- ⚡ One-prompt automation for social posting
- 🛠️ Custom MCP server implementation
- 🐦 Secure Twitter API integration
- 📈 Encourages consistent build-in-public habits

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js**
- **TypeScript**
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**
- **Visual Studio Code**
- **GitHub Copilot**
- **Twitter API**

## Challenges & Learnings

- Designing safe AI-triggered actions
- Structuring meaningful prompts without leaking sensitive context
- Handling authentication and API rate limits
- Building reliable automation around daily developer workflows

## Outcome

- Made build-in-public effortless and consistent
- Increased accountability in daily DSA practice
- Created a reusable automation workflow
- Strengthened understanding of AI system design

## Future Improvements

- Multi-platform posting (LinkedIn, Dev.to)
- Post scheduling and draft previews
- Analytics for engagement tracking
- Support for configurable post tone and length

## Closing Note

This project reflects my interest in **developer experience**, **AI automation**, and **workflow optimization**, showcasing how small personal problems can be solved with thoughtful system design.
