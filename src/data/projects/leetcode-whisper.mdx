## Overview

**LeetCode Whisper** is a Chrome extension built to help developers solve problems on LeetCode **without giving away the final solution**.
Instead of returning full answers or code, the extension generates **context-aware hints, approach-level guidance, and edge-case prompts**, allowing users to stay engaged with the actual problem-solving process.

The project focuses on **responsible AI usage** in developer tooling, where the model behaves like a mentor that _nudges_ the user forward rather than solving the problem for them.

---

## Motivation

Most AI coding tools instantly provide complete solutions, which often leads to:

- Reduced problem-solving ability
- Shallow understanding of algorithms
- Over-dependence on generated code

LeetCode Whisper intentionally avoids that pattern by:

- Blocking full solutions
- Encouraging incremental reasoning
- Providing just enough guidance to unblock users

---

## How LeetCode Whisper Works

### High-Level Flow

1. The user opens a LeetCode problem
2. LeetCode Whisper reads the **problem context directly from the DOM**
3. Extracted content is cleaned and refined
4. The refined context is combined with the user’s query
5. A constrained prompt is sent to an LLM
6. The response is filtered to return **only hints and guidance**

---

## DOM Extraction & Context Processing

The extension uses **Chrome content scripts** to access the LeetCode page and extract:

- Problem description
- Constraints
- Input/output format
- Example cases

Before sending data to the LLM:

- HTML noise is removed
- Redundant text is stripped
- Content is normalized into a structured format
- Token usage is optimized to reduce API cost

This ensures the model receives **high-signal input** instead of raw page content.

---

## Prompt Engineering Strategy

The prompt design is intentionally restrictive:

- ❌ No full solutions
- ❌ No complete code snippets
- ✅ Conceptual hints
- ✅ Algorithmic direction
- ✅ Edge-case awareness

Typical responses include:

- Suggested data structures
- Time and space complexity considerations
- Problem decomposition strategies
- Common pitfalls to avoid

---

## Tech Stack

### Frontend & UI

- **React**
- **TypeScript**
- Component-based architecture
- Minimal, distraction-free UI

### Build System

- **Vite**
- Fast development feedback
- Optimized production builds

### Chrome Extension APIs

- Content scripts for DOM access
- Secure message passing
- Isolated execution environments

### AI Integration

- LLM accessed using a **user-provided API key**
- No keys stored or logged
- Client-side request execution
- Token-aware prompt construction

---

## Security & Privacy

LeetCode Whisper is designed with privacy in mind:

- Users provide **their own API token**
- No credentials are persisted
- No problem data is stored or tracked
- All requests are explicitly user-initiated

This makes the extension transparent, user-controlled, and privacy-first.
